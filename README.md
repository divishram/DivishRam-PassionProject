# Game Review Articles

This is a database that store the articles for game reviews. It includes the title, rating, summary etc. It is linked
to the publishers. It is also linked to the stores that sell the games, e.g. BestBuy, EBgames etc.

There are a few issues with the code. It does not load the views properly, even though the basic CRUD is demonstrated through
the command line.

In the future I hope to fix the views and add an authorization, so only authorized users can change the data.
I would also like to add the ability to add pictures with the games that they upload. 

I hope to also include videos so users can show examples of some gameplay.
